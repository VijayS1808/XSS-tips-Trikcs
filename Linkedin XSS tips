XSS Tip: ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯

If your Payload is reflecting between the title tags or noscript tags in the response code, make sure you get out of them as you cannot execute JS up there on the title-bar and also your payload won't execute between the noscript tags.

Use payloads like this would bring you out from title and noscript:

</title><script>alert(1)</script>
</noscript><script>alert(1)</script>
